###install of labelImg
https://tzutalin.github.io/labelImg/
download linux_v1.4.3 
unzip file
#open terminal
cd to linux_v1.4.3 directory
sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools
pip3 install labelImg
labelImg

### How to train your model
Create a folder for train and validate folder
Put training image and validate image to respective folder
Use labelImg to box out object for detection
***Note:The box out image should be save on the same folder as image***
The saved image will come out as .xml file

#Go to colab to train own model
https://colab.research.google.com/github/khanhlvg/tflite_raspberry_pi/blob/main/object_detection/Train_custom_model_tutorial.ipynb
Upload your file to the File folder on the top left
###change this to your own custom training image
train_data = object_detector.DataLoader.from_pascal_voc(
    'android_figurine/train',
    'android_figurine/train',
    ['android', 'pig_android']
)

val_data = object_detector.DataLoader.from_pascal_voc(
    'android_figurine/validate',
    'android_figurine/validate',
    ['android', 'pig_android']
)

###Exporting out the tflite file 
change to the model name you want to export
model.export(export_dir='.', tflite_filename='android.tflite')
from File folder download the tflite file
